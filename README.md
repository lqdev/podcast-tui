#### Using DevContainer (Recommended for Development)
1. Install [Docker](https://docker.com) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Install the [Remote-Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Clone the repository and open in VS Code
4. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
5. Run `cargo run` to start the application

### First Run
1. Start the application: `podcast-tui`
2. Press `a` to add your first podcast subscription
3. Enter an RSS feed URL (try: `https://feeds.simplecast.com/54nAGcIl`)
4. Press `r` to refresh the feed and load episodes
5. Navigate with `C-n`/`C-p`, press `RET` to play an episode

## üéπ Keybindings

Podcast TUI uses Emacs-style keybindings for efficient keyboard navigation:

### Navigation
- `C-n` / `C-p` - Next/previous item
- `C-f` / `C-b` - Move right/left  
- `C-a` / `C-e` - Beginning/end of line
- `RET` - Select/activate item

### Buffer Management
- `C-x b` - Switch between buffers (podcasts, episodes, playlists)
- `C-x 1` - Focus current buffer
- `C-x 2` - Split horizontally
- `C-x 3` - Split vertically
- `C-x o` - Switch window

### Podcast Management
- `a` - Add new podcast subscription
- `d` - Delete selected podcast
- `r` - Refresh selected podcast feed
- `R` - Refresh all podcast feeds

### Episode Management  
- `RET` - Play selected episode
- `D` - Download episode
- `X` - Delete downloaded file
- `C-x` - Delete ALL downloaded episodes and clean up
- `N` - Add/edit episode note
- `m` - Mark as played/unplayed

### Playback Controls
- `SPC` - Play/pause
- `s` - Stop playback
- `f` / `b` - Seek forward/backward (30s)
- `+` / `-` - Volume up/down
- `n` / `p` - Next/previous episode

### Help System
- `C-h ?` - Help overview
- `C-h k` - Describe key
- `C-h b` - Show all keybindings

See [complete keybinding reference](docs/EMACS_KEYBINDINGS.md) for all shortcuts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is stored in JSON format at:
- Linux: `~/.config/podcast-tui/config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/podcast-tui/config.json`

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "downloads": {
    "directory": "~/Downloads/Podcasts",
    "concurrent": 3,
    "cleanup_after_days": 30
  },
  "audio": {
    "volume": 0.8,
    "seek_seconds": 30
  },
  "keybindings": {
    "play_pause": "SPC",
    "next_episode": "n",
    "prev_episode": "p"
  },
  "ui": {
    "theme": "default",
    "show_progress_bar": true
  }
}
```

See [configuration documentation](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for all options.

## üìÅ Data Storage

Podcast TUI uses JSON files for data storage:

```
~/.local/share/podcast-tui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json                 # Application configuration  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podcasts/                   # Podcast subscriptions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {podcast-id}.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ episodes/                   # Episode metadata and notes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {podcast-id}/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {episode-id}.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playlists/                  # User playlists
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {playlist-id}.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stats.json                  # Usage statistics
```

This design allows for:
- Easy manual editing of data
- Simple backup (copy directory)
- Version control friendly
- Future storage backend options

## üîß Development

### Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Storage Layer** - Abstracted JSON-based persistence
- **Domain Logic** - Podcast, episode, and playlist management
- **UI Layer** - Emacs-style terminal interface using Ratatui
- **Audio System** - Cross-platform playback with Rodio

See [architecture documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
