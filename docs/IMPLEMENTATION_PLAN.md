- Cross-component interactions
- Error handling scenarios

### Manual Testing
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Terminal emulator compatibility
- User workflow validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Audio playback issues**: Early prototype, fallback to external players
2. **Cross-platform bugs**: Continuous cross-platform testing
3. **Performance problems**: Regular profiling and optimization
4. **RSS parsing edge cases**: Comprehensive test feed collection

### Project Risks  
1. **Scope creep**: Strict MVP focus, feature parking lot
2. **Timeline pressure**: Aggressive prioritization, feature dropping
3. **Technical debt**: Regular refactoring, code quality focus
4. **Single developer**: Clear documentation, modular design
