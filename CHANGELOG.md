  - **Theme System**: 4 complete themes (dark, light, high-contrast, solarized) with consistent styling
- **Main Application Loop**: Robust async application framework
  - Complete UIApp with 60fps event loop, efficient rendering, comprehensive action handling
  - Command execution system supporting M-x Emacs-style commands (quit, help, theme, buffer)
  - Dynamic theme switching, buffer switching, integrated help system
  - Proper async event handling with terminal cleanup and error recovery
- **Sprint 0 Foundation**: Complete Rust project structure and backend systems

  - **Utilities**: Helper modules for file system, time formatting, and validation

### Changed
- Updated implementation plan to reflect completed Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 objectives
- Enhanced README with current MVP progress status showing Sprint 1 completion
- Improved git repository hygiene with proper .gitignore for Rust projects

### Fixed  
- Episode `is_played()` logic now correctly respects status vs historical play count
- Storage layer properly handles serialization errors without anyhow dependencies
- Git repository size issues by removing build artifacts and adding comprehensive .gitignore
- All compilation errors in UI framework with proper async/trait implementations
- Theme system now supports "default" theme alias for better backwards compatibility
