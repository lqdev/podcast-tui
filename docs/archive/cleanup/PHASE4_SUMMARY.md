## üîó Documentation Architecture

### Primary Technical Anchor
**docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** (500+ lines) - Now prominently referenced from:
- README.md (3 references)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (5 references)
- All new contributor onboarding paths

### Documentation Hierarchy
```
Entry Point: README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí GETTING_STARTED.md (users)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí CONTRIBUTING.md (developers)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí ARCHITECTURE.md (technical)
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí copilot-instructions.md (code patterns)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí docs/archive/ (historical)
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Results

### Link Validation
- ‚úÖ 10+ ARCHITECTURE.md references found across documents
- ‚úÖ Zero broken references to deleted files (QUICKSTART.md, BUILD_COMMANDS.md)
- ‚úÖ All cross-references validated
- ‚úÖ Historical documents properly note deletions

### Content Accuracy
- ‚úÖ Sprint status accurate (3/8 = 37.5% complete)
- ‚úÖ All feature statuses match implementation
- ‚úÖ Build documentation references current files only
- ‚úÖ Architecture descriptions match actual code

## üìä Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 3 (README.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Files Created**: 2 (PHASE4_COMPLETE.md, this summary)
- **New Cross-References**: 10+ links to ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Sections Enhanced**: 8 major documentation sections
- **Broken References Removed**: 2 (to deleted files)
- **Lines Added**: ~600 (including completion report)

## üéØ Overall Cleanup Progress

### Completed Phases (4/5 = 80%)
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Documentation Cleanup (19 files archived, 5 deleted, structure organized)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Create Missing Documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md created with 500+ lines)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Code Refactoring (constants module, clippy fixes, 73/73 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Update Existing Documentation (3 files updated, cross-references added)

### Remaining Phase (1/5 = 20%)
- ‚è≥ Phase 5: Add Missing Tests (integration tests, property-based tests, coverage)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Option 1: Commit Phase 4 Changes
```powershell
git add README.md docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md CONTRIBUTING.md PHASE4_COMPLETE.md PHASE4_SUMMARY.md
git commit -m "docs: update existing documentation for Phase 4

- Add prominent ARCHITECTURE.md references throughout
- Update sprint status (Sprints 0-1 marked complete)
- Add progress summary to implementation plan (37.5% complete)
- Enhance contributing guide with architecture guidelines
- Reorganize documentation sections for clarity
- Add constants module and code style references
- Remove references to deleted documentation files
- Add comprehensive cross-references between docs

Completes Phase 4 of PROJECT_CLEANUP.md plan."
```

### Option 2: Proceed to Phase 5
