## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is stored in JSON format at:
- Linux: `~/.config/podcast-tui/config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/podcast-tui/config.json`

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "downloads": {
    "directory": "~/Downloads/Podcasts",
    "concurrent": 3,
    "cleanup_after_days": 30
  },
  "audio": {
    "volume": 0.8,
    "seek_seconds": 30
  },
  "keybindings": {
    "play_pause": "SPC",
    "next_episode": "n",
    "prev_episode": "p"
  },
  "ui": {
    "theme": "default",
    "show_progress_bar": true
  }
}
```

See [configuration documentation](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for all options.

## üìÅ Data Storage

Podcast TUI uses JSON files for data storage:

```
~/.local/share/podcast-tui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json                 # Application configuration  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podcasts/                   # Podcast subscriptions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {podcast-id}.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ episodes/                   # Episode metadata and notes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {podcast-id}/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {episode-id}.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playlists/                  # User playlists
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {playlist-id}.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stats.json                  # Usage statistics
```

This design allows for:
- Easy manual editing of data
- Simple backup (copy directory)
- Version control friendly
- Future storage backend options
