- **Memory**: < 200MB normal operation
- **Storage**: Local JSON files in organized structure
- **Concurrency**: 2-3 simultaneous downloads
- **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking UI during I/O operations

### Cross-Platform
- **Primary**: Windows 10+, Ubuntu 20.04+
- **Terminal**: Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal, other major emulators
- **Audio**: Cross-platform audio libraries with fallback options
- **Files**: Platform-appropriate file paths and permissions

## User Experience Requirements

### Navigation Model
- **Emacs-style**: C-n/C-p for navigation, C-x for commands
- **Buffers**: Switch between podcasts, episodes, playlists views
- **Minibuffer**: Command input area for text commands
- **Help**: C-h help system with keybinding discovery

### Interface Design
- **Responsive**: Adapts to terminal size gracefully
- **Information Dense**: Efficient use of screen space
- **Clear Focus**: Always visible focus indicators
- **Status Communication**: Clear progress and status messages

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard-Only**: Full functionality without mouse
- **Screen Reader**: Compatible with terminal screen readers
- **Color**: Graceful degradation for limited color terminals
- **Font**: Works with standard terminal fonts

## Data Management

### Storage Design
```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json                 # Application configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ podcasts/                   # Podcast definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {podcast-id}.json
â”œâ”€â”€ episodes/                   # Episode metadata and notes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {podcast-id}/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {episode-id}.json
â”œâ”€â”€ playlists/                  # User-created playlists
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {playlist-id}.json
â”œâ”€â”€ stats.json                  # Usage statistics
â””â”€â”€ downloads/                  # Downloaded audio files
    â”œâ”€â”€ {podcast-name}/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {episode-name}.mp3
```

### Data Models
- **Podcast**: RSS URL, metadata, last refresh, settings overrides
- **Episode**: Metadata, download status, play progress, user notes
- **Playlist**: Name, episode list, play order, creation date
- **Statistics**: Play counts, listening time, download stats

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Audio Compatibility**: Different audio formats/codecs across platforms
  - *Mitigation*: Use proven cross-platform libraries, provide external player fallback
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Varying terminal emulator capabilities
  - *Mitigation*: Test on major emulators, graceful feature degradation
- **Performance**: Large podcast libraries causing slowdowns
  - *Mitigation*: Lazy loading, efficient data structures, performance monitoring

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Adding non-MVP features during development
  - *Mitigation*: Strict MVP focus, feature parking lot for future versions
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Windows/Linux differences causing problems
  - *Mitigation*: Early cross-platform testing, use of proven libraries
- **Time Constraints**: 8-week timeline being too aggressive
  - *Mitigation*: Aggressive feature prioritization, early prototype validation
