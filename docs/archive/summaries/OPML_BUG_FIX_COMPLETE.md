# 🎉 OPML Import Bug Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Solved
Your OPML import from `https://www.lqdev.me/collections/podroll/index.opml` was failing with an error.

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing `@text` Attribute ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: OPML 2.0 spec requires `@text`, but your file only has `@title`  
**Solution**: Made `@text` optional, fall back to `@title` then `"Untitled"`

### Issue 2: Unescaped Ampersands ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: XML like `title="Security & Privacy"` needs `&amp;` not `&`  
**Solution**: Added XML sanitization that fixes unescaped entities before parsing

## What Changed
- ✅ `src/podcast/opml.rs` - Added sanitization + flexible attribute handling
- ✅ `Cargo.toml` - Added `regex` dependency for entity fixing
- ✅ `tests/test_opml_live_url.rs` - New test for your exact URL
- ✅ `tests/test_opml_local_file.rs` - New test for local file with same issues
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented new features and fixes

## Test Results
```
✅ All 8 OPML tests passing (6 unit + 2 integration)
✅ Release build successful (1m 22s)
✅ Successfully parsed your OPML: Found 27 feeds!
```
