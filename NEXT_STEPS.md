### Current Sprint: Sprint 2 - RSS and Podcasts (Week 3)

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Day 5-6: Podcast UI (Priority 1)

- Add "Refresh All" command
- Show progress indicator during refresh
- Display count of new episodes found

**3. Delete Subscription UI** (Day 6)
- Add "Delete Subscription" command
- Implement confirmation dialog
- Update podcast list after deletion

**4. Enhanced Podcast List Buffer** (Day 6)
- Integrate with SubscriptionManager to load real data
- Add keybindings for:
  - `C-x a` - Add new subscription
  - `r` - Refresh current podcast
  - `R` - Refresh all podcasts
  - `d` - Delete subscription
- Show podcast metadata (episodes count, last updated)
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### Day 7: OPML Foundation
**OPML Import/Export** (Basic implementation)
- Parse OPML XML format
- Import multiple subscriptions from OPML file
- Export current subscriptions to OPML
- Add `M-x import-opml` and `M-x export-opml` commands

- [ ] Document public APIs with examples

### UI Polish
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Loading indicators
- [ ] Help text improvements
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut hints

### Storage Improvements

## üöÄ How to Continue Development

### Test Current Features:
```bash
cd /workspaces/podcast-tui
cargo run
```

### Next Task to Implement:
**Start with the Podcast List UI integration** - this will make the subscription manager actually usable!

1. Open `src/ui/buffers/podcast_list.rs`
2. Add methods to load podcasts using `SubscriptionManager`
3. Implement the add/delete/refresh commands
4. Connect keybindings to the commands
5. Test with real RSS feeds

### Example Test Feeds:
```
- BBC World Service: https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/p02nq0gn.rss
- The Daily: https://feeds.simplecast.com/54nAGcIl
- Reply All: https://feeds.megaphone.fm/replyall
```

### Testing Your Changes:
```bash
# Build and run
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check for issues
cargo clippy
```

## üí° Development Tips

### Following Copilot Instructions:
1. **Always code against Storage trait** - Never directly use JsonStorage
2. **Use async/await** for I/O operations
3. **Proper error handling** - No unwrap() in user-facing code
4. **Buffer-based UI** - Follow Emacs paradigms
5. **Test as you go** - Write tests for business logic

### Common Patterns:
```rust
// Error handling
.await
.map_err(|e| SubscriptionError::Storage(e.to_string()))?

// Async operations
let result = tokio::spawn(async move {
    // Long operation
}).await??;

// UI updates
self.minibuffer.set_content(MinibufferContent::Message(msg));
```

### When Stuck:
1. Check the implementation plan (docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
2. Look at similar existing code
3. Read the copilot instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
4. Focus on MVP features first

**Current Priority: Implement Podcast List UI with real data integration**

Good luck! üéâ
