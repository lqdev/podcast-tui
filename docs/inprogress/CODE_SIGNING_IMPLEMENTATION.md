## What Still Needs to Be Done

### ðŸ”´ Certificate Acquisition (Priority: Medium)

The main blocker is acquiring a code signing certificate. This requires:

1. **Decision on Certificate Type**
   - **Recommended:** OV Certificate ($100-300/year) - Good balance for CI/CD
   - **Best (but expensive):** EV Certificate ($300-600/year) - Immediate trust
   - **Budget:** Standard Certificate ($50-150/year) - Takes longer to build trust

2. **Provider Selection**
   - Recommended: SSL.com (OV), DigiCert (EV), Sectigo (OV/Standard)
   - Consider: Open source discounts, bulk pricing

3. **Business Verification**
   - Individual developer OR business entity
   - May take 2-10 business days
   - Required documents vary by provider

4. **Purchase and Setup**
   - Budget: $50-600/year ongoing cost
   - Timeline: 2-10 business days for verification + setup

### ðŸŸ¡ GitHub Secrets Configuration (Priority: High - After Certificate)

Once certificate is acquired:

1. **Add Secrets to GitHub Repository**
   - Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Add `WINDOWS_CERT_BASE64` + `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` (for OV/Standard)
   - OR `WINDOWS_CERT_THUMBPRINT` (for self-hosted runner with EV)

2. **Test Signing**
   - Create test tag: `v0.0.0-test-signing`
   - Verify workflow signs binaries
   - Download and verify signature

### ðŸŸ¢ Testing and Validation (Priority: Medium - After Setup)

After certificate is configured:

1. **Local Testing**
   - Test signing script with actual certificate
   - Verify signature with `signtool verify`
   - Check signature details in Windows Explorer

2. **CI/CD Testing**
   - Test GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify signed binaries in artifacts
   - Test on clean Windows machine

3. **User Testing**
   - Download signed binary as end user
   - Verify no SmartScreen warnings appear
   - Verify publisher name displays correctly

### ðŸŸ¢ Documentation Updates (Priority: Low - After Deployment)

After first signed release:

1. Update documentation to reflect actual experience
2. Add screenshots of signed binaries
3. Document any issues encountered
4. Update cost/timeline estimates if different

## Technical Implementation Details

### How It Works

1. **Local Development:**
   ```powershell
   # Build creates binary
   cargo build --release
   
   # Script attempts to sign (optional)
   ./scripts/sign-windows-binary.ps1 -BinaryPath "target/release/podcast-tui.exe" -SkipIfNoCert
   
   # Build completes (with or without signing)
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions:**
   ```yaml
   - Build Windows releases
   - Sign Windows binaries (if secrets configured)
   - Upload artifacts
   - Create GitHub Release
   ```

3. **Certificate Methods:**
   - **Base64:** Certificate stored as GitHub secret, decoded at runtime
   - **Thumbprint:** Certificate installed on runner, referenced by hash

### Signing Process

1. Load certificate (from store or .pfx file)
2. Try primary timestamp server (DigiCert)
3. If failed, try alternate servers (Sectigo, GlobalSign, etc.)
4. Sign with SHA256 digest algorithm
5. Verify signature
6. Report success or failure

### Fallback Behavior

- If no certificate: Build continues without signing
- If timestamp fails: Attempts multiple servers, then signs without timestamp
- If signing fails: Logs warning but doesn't fail build

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs

| Item | Cost | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| OV Certificate | $100-300 | Annual |
| EV Certificate | $300-600 | Annual |
| Setup Time | 4-8 hours | One-time |
| Verification Time | 2-10 days | Per certificate |

### Benefits

- âœ… Eliminates SmartScreen warnings
- âœ… Displays verified publisher name
- âœ… Reduces false positive malware detections
- âœ… Improves user trust and confidence
- âœ… Professional appearance
- âœ… Easier distribution (fewer support tickets)

### ROI Considerations

- **High-value for:** Production releases, enterprise users, paid products
- **Medium-value for:** Open source with active users (reduces support burden)
- **Lower priority for:** Early development, personal projects, niche tools

## Recommendations

### For This Project

Given the project's status (Sprint 3 complete, active development):

1. **Now:** Continue without signing (infrastructure is ready)
2. **Before v1.0:** Acquire OV certificate ($100-300/year)
3. **Post v1.0:** Consider upgrading to EV if enterprise adoption grows

### Certificate Provider Recommendation

**Best option for this project:** SSL.com OV Code Signing Certificate
- âœ… Good price (~$150/year with discounts)
- âœ… Works well with CI/CD (file-based)
- âœ… Reputable provider
- âœ… Good documentation
- âœ… Reasonable verification process

### Timeline Estimate

If certificate is purchased today:
- **Day 1-2:** Application and document submission
- **Day 3-7:** Verification process
- **Day 8:** Certificate issuance
- **Day 8-9:** GitHub secrets configuration and testing
- **Day 10:** First signed release

**Total:** ~2 weeks from purchase to first signed release
